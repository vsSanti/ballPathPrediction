# ballPathPrediction
The project uses Java and OpenCV to detect a ball and predict its path in real time for a predefined set of videos.

Detection was achieved by using a combination of median blur, color convertions, color range exclusion, and Hough Transform, while the resulting mathematical prediction used Newton's method and was displayed via Swing.
